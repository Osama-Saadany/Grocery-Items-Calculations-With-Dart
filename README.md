# Grocery Cost Calculator

This Dart program calculates the total cost of grocery items, including taxes. It uses a list of grocery items represented as maps, each containing a name and price. The program loops through the list to compute the total price before tax and then applies a constant tax rate of **10%** to determine the final price.
